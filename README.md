# NDIV
This repository takes NDVI data for 16 day MODIS imagery. The specific code represents clips the data to showcase Uganda in the year 2020. I chose to look at NDVI values in Uganda after a conversation with a Ugandan friend. She recently sent Google earth images of her fathersâ€™ rural farm to him and he was shocked to learn what was visible from space and that she could access the images of Uganda from Boston. I was excited to make this for him to show him a sample of how much information is really accessible about his country. 
## Interpretation 
The NDVI values range from tan to dark green with dark green representing the darkest, most dense vegetation values. The GIF shows NDVI values for the year 2020, which experienced a wetter year than normal. The large white space at the Southeastern corner of Uganda is a portion of Lake Victoria, which is white since water does not have greenness values. Lake Albert is also visible on the Western border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Lake Kyoga in the central part of the country that both show large swaths of white values. 
Rainy season in Uganda runs from March-May and then again from September to November. Dry season is generally from December to February. Looking at the NDVI color values, the onset of dry season can be distinctly seen in the northwestern part of the country at the end of the series by the drastic reduction in greenness and also in the growth of the tan values. This decline in greenness spreads from the top, northeastern, part of the country down to the bottom, southwestern portion. The southwestern part of the country experiences fairly consistently high levels of greenness throughout the year
